Hello All! This is the first line in my Github adventure. I am RyoshiBee an aspiring system admin looking to utomate as much as possible as i run through different users and scenarios that are pretty clearcut and could be easy to handle once you get used to them
But i digress. There is only so much time to complete tasks at a given day. So what do you do? If you need to you can always create things to complete task for you, probably with more preceision too!
I want to start implementing these methods along with CI/CD pipelines in hopes i can live more along the philosophy of infrastructure as code. Hopefully i will not be deterred by the sheer amount of knowledge available. Looking forward to learning more and thank you to all who stayed long enough reading.
